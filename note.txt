meteostat:
the weather condition code (coco) has large portion of NaN in 2018 and before, but later data has higher quality. Interpretation of coco is in https://dev.meteostat.net/formats.html#weather-condition-codes

I will manually download flight on-time performance data

Only take 3 popular airlines(UA, AA, DELTA) and 5 popular origin airports(EWR, JFK, SFO, ORD, DFW). But there is not UA flight from JFK

No duplication among origin and dest airports since we only specify origin airports.
