== CONCLUSIONS ==
1. The weather conditions with the most significant impact on flight delays are:
   - Overcast
   - Light Snowfall
   - Freezing Rain

2. Weather conditions at the origin airport tend to cause longer delays than at the destination.

3. The majority of weather delays occur when these specific conditions are present:
   - Sleet (2.28% of flights delayed)
   - Heavy Rain (2.13% of flights delayed)
   - Freezing Rain (1.37% of flights delayed)

This analysis provides insights into how different weather conditions at origin and destination airports affect flight delays. For more detailed visualizations, refer to the plots in the coco_analysis_output directory.
